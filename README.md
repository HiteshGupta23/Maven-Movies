# Maven Movies SQL Analysis

### Project Title:
Unlocking Business Insights for Maven Movies – A SQL-Driven Operational Analysis

### Project Summary:
This project explores the business operations of a fictional DVD rental company, Maven Movies, through a set of real-world business questions provided by potential investors. The aim is to uncover insights related to customer behavior, store performance, staff contribution, inventory diversity, and financial risk using structured SQL queries.

By addressing operational challenges across multiple departments, this project demonstrates how SQL can transform raw relational data into valuable insights that support strategic decision-making.


## Problem Statement

Maven Movies is under consideration for acquisition. Before proceeding, potential investors want to understand how well the company operates across key dimensions:

- Are customers engaged and profitable?

- How efficient and productive are the staff and stores?

- What financial and security risks exist?

- Is the film catalog attractive and diverse enough to maintain customer interest?

- Are there any gaps in content or customer service that could affect growth?

The challenge lies in retrieving and presenting this information from a complex SQL database in a way that is accurate, business-relevant, and easy to interpret.

## Solution Approach

A series of 16 business questions were answered using SQL, covering various themes such as:

- **Store & Staff Performance:** Identifying the managers, measuring staff contributions, and reviewing store operations.

- **Customer Analysis:** Segmenting customers based on activity and spending to find high-value individuals.

- **Inventory Insights:** Exploring inventory distribution, film categories, and replacement cost risks.

- **Financial Patterns:** Evaluating payment trends and potential fraud indicators.

- **Compliance & Risk:** Assessing stored customer data and understanding liabilities.

- **Content Strategy:** Reviewing how well the catalog covers award-winning actors.

Each question was solved through carefully constructed SQL queries, using joins, aggregates, groupings, and subqueries. Outputs were interpreted with business logic to deliver meaningful insights.
